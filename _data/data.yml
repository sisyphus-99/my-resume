        1.实现单目相机到车辆的外参标定：使用基于transformer的网络预测图片消失点和地平线，计算相机与道路的旋转，统计一段时间内的结果估计相机与车辆的旋转
        2.实现激光雷达到车辆的外参标定：使用SLAM算法得到激光雷达6DoF位姿，平滑x-y轨迹曲线得到车辆前进方向，根据车辆前进方向与激光雷达的x轴坐标来标定yaw角；提取地面标定pitch,roll角。
        3.使用与激光雷达同样方法标定GNSS/INS集成设备与车辆的yaw角
        4.优化毫米波雷达到车辆的外参标定：在原有方法上加入车辆定位信息，优化不同帧的权重系数
        + 基于分割的相机与激光雷达外参标定（进行中，论文完成初稿，[代码开源](https://github.com/OpenCalib/CalibAnything)）
        1.该方法是对原有相机与激光雷达标定方法的改进。原方法分割出车道线，电线杆进行匹配，对场景要求高。
        2.本方法使用Segmnet Anything 对图片进行分割，并计算各个mask内投影点云的一致性来优化外参。经过在KITTI和内部数据上的实验，方法的通用性，准确性较好，且不需要训练。

    Including an interest section in your resume can be helpful if your interests are relevant to the job you are applying for, such as if you are applying for a job in a creative field and your hobbies include painting or writing. It can also be useful if you are applying for a job where teamwork or social skills are important, and you can mention interests that demonstrate those qualities.

    In this section, you can highlight your achievements, areas of expertise, and any unique qualities or experiences that set you apart from other candidates. You can also mention areas where you are looking to improve or gain further experience.

    A well-crafted self-evaluation section can demonstrate your self-awareness and confidence in your abilities, as well as your willingness to continuously learn and grow.

    A reference section in a resume is a list of individuals who can vouch for your skills, work ethic, and character. These individuals are typically former managers, colleagues, or mentors who have worked closely with you in the past and can provide insight into your abilities and work style.

    It's important to note that including a reference section in a resume is not always necessary, and some employers may prefer to request references separately. If you do choose to include a reference section, it should typically be located at the end of your resume.

    When listing references, be sure to include the individual's name, job title, company name, phone number, and email address. It's also a good idea to ask for the individual's permission before listing them as a reference, and to let them know what kind of job you are applying for so they can speak to your relevant skills and experience.

    It's important to choose references who can provide a positive and comprehensive evaluation of your work. Avoid listing family members or friends as references, and instead focus on individuals who can speak to your professional abilities and accomplishments.
