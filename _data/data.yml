          （1）单目相机到车辆的外参标定：使用基于transformer的回归网络预测图片消失点和地平线，计算相机与道路的旋转，统计一段时间内的结果估计相机与车辆的旋转角。
        
          （2）激光雷达到车辆的外参标定：用F-LOAM得到激光雷达6DoF位姿，平滑x-y轨迹曲线得到车辆前进方向，根据车辆前进方向与激光雷达的主轴方向的offset来计算yaw角；提取地面标定pitch,roll角。
        
          （3）GNSS/INS到车辆标定：使用与激光雷达同样方法标定GNSS/INS集成设备与车辆的yaw角。
        
          （4）毫米波雷达到车辆的外参标定：假设目标中静态物体占大多数，静态物体被雷达检测到的多普勒速度为车速在径向的分量。通过车速，目标速度，目标所在角度可以估计yaw角。

          （5）四种方法在kitti,nuscenes,radarscenes等数据集上进行实验。完成论文: [<font color="blue"> SensorX2car Sensors-to-car calibration for autonomous driving in road scenarios </font>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07279). RAL期刊在投。

        + **自动驾驶数据生成系统**
          
          （1）项目内容：对实车采集的数据进行基于神经渲染的隐式三维重建，然后将路网和路由信息导入交通流仿真。在仿真过程中通过编辑自车轨迹等重新生成车辆轨迹。再将车辆轨迹输入三维重建模型得到新的仿真数据。

          （2）本人负责内容：在交通流仿真系统中修改原图形化界面，加入交互操作，使得用户能在界面中选定车辆轨迹，并对修改后的轨迹重新进行仿真。

    The patent section in a resume is a dedicated section where you can showcase any patents that you have been granted or are in the process of obtaining. This section is particularly relevant for individuals who work in scientific or technical fields, as well as for individuals who have developed innovative products or technologies.

    In this section, you should list the title of the patent, the name of the inventors, the patent number, and the date it was granted. If the patent is pending, you can indicate that it is "pending" or "in review." You may also want to provide a brief description of the technology or invention that the patent covers.

    Including a patent section in your resume can help demonstrate your expertise and accomplishments in your field, and can help you stand out from other candidates. However, if you do not have any patents to list, it is not necessary to include this section in your resume.

    Template for a pending patent:

    + [Inventor Name]. [Pursued Year]. [Title]. [Patent Number], filed [Submitted Date]. Patent pending.

    Template for an approved patent:

    + [Inventor Name]. [Pursued Year]. [Title]. [Patent Number], filed [Submitted Date], [Received Date].

    The following are some examples of patent formats.

    + Foo Bar. 2022. Example patent name one. US 123456, filed Oct 3, 2022. Patent pending.

    The interests section in a resume typically refers to a section where you can mention your hobbies, interests, and activities outside of work or school. This section can give potential employers a better idea of your personality, your values, and your interests beyond your professional experience.

    Including an interest section in your resume can be helpful if your interests are relevant to the job you are applying for, such as if you are applying for a job in a creative field and your hobbies include painting or writing. It can also be useful if you are applying for a job where teamwork or social skills are important, and you can mention interests that demonstrate those qualities.

    However, it is important to be selective when including an interest section in your resume, and to choose interests that are appropriate and professional. Avoid including controversial or potentially offensive interests, and focus on interests that showcase your positive qualities and strengths.

    A reference section in a resume is a list of individuals who can vouch for your skills, work ethic, and character. These individuals are typically former managers, colleagues, or mentors who have worked closely with you in the past and can provide insight into your abilities and work style.

    It's important to note that including a reference section in a resume is not always necessary, and some employers may prefer to request references separately. If you do choose to include a reference section, it should typically be located at the end of your resume.

    When listing references, be sure to include the individual's name, job title, company name, phone number, and email address. It's also a good idea to ask for the individual's permission before listing them as a reference, and to let them know what kind of job you are applying for so they can speak to your relevant skills and experience.

    It's important to choose references who can provide a positive and comprehensive evaluation of your work. Avoid listing family members or friends as references, and instead focus on individuals who can speak to your professional abilities and accomplishments.
